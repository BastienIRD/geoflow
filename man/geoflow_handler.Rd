}
\value{
Object of \code{\link{R6Class}} for modelling a handler
}
\description{
This class models a content handler. An handler is a method to handle
some content (eg entity or contact). It is mainly driven by a function that takes
as argument a \code{config} object, as the overall configuration created by geoflow 
\code{initWorkflow} function, and a source which identifiers the source to be handled,
that can be of a different type (eg a URL, a file path) depending on the handler.
}

}
\note{
This class is essentially called internally by geoflow to register default handlers
for entities and contacts.

\section{Methods}{

\describe{
 \item{\code{new(id, def, packages, fun, script)}}{
   This method is used to instantiate a geoflow_handler object
 }
 \item{\code{checkPackages()}}{
   Check that all packages required for the handler are available, if yes,
   import them in the R session, and return a \code{data.frame} giving the 
   packages names and version. If one or more packages are unavailable,
   an error is thrown and user informed of the missing packages.
 }
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
  handler <- geoflow_handler$new(
   id = "some-id",
   def = "some definition",
   packages = list(),
   fun = function(config, source){}
 )
}
