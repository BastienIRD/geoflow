#### 4.1 How to install geoflow

For now, the package can be installed from Github
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
```
Once the ``remotes`` package loaded, you can use the install_github to install ``geoflow``. By default, package will be installed from ``master`` which is the current version in development (likely to be unstable). 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
require("remotes")
install_github("eblondel/geoflow")
```

<a name="geoflow_execute"/>

#### 4.2 How to use geoflow in R

In R, using ``geoflow`` consists essentially in running the function ``executeWorkflow", which takes a single parameter: the name of a configuration file in JSON format:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
executeWorkflow("config.json")
```

The workflow that is going to be executed is entirely described in a configuration file. The main preparatory work of the data manager will then to prepare the configuration file, depending on the tasks to perform.

Prior to the execution, it also possible to check that the configuration is ready to execute geoflow tasks. For that, once the configuration is ready, it is possible to check it with the the function ``initWorkflow``:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
config <- initWorkflow("config.json")
```

> Note: It is planned to offer a shiny app interface, through geoflow, that will allow configure the workflow in a user-friendly manner (The shiny app will then take care of creating the appropriate JSON configuration file in a transparent way)

<a name="geoflow_config"/>

#### 4.3 Description of a geoflow configuration

Before creating a configuration file first let's describe how the ``geoflow`` is structured and what are the key concepts.

<a name="geoflow_config_structure"/>

##### 4.3.1 Overall structure

###### Description

A geoflow configuration contains several parts (some that are optional) that are defined here below.

Name | Definition | Optional/Required
-----|------------|-------------------
[**id**](#geoflow_config_id)|A string identifier/name for the workflow|Required
[**mode**](#geoflow_config_mode)|A string, either 'raw' or 'entity' that defines the workflow mode: <br>* _raw_ mode: simple mode that allows to trigger basic tasks with R (known in geoflow as _actions_) in sequential way. This mode can be used by users that just want to chain R scripts. <br>* _entity_ mode: mode were all the _actions_ will be performed based on a set of entities. In geoflow, an ``entity`` includes both metadata and data elements. In most of cases, an _entity_ will describe a dataset for which we want to perform actions such as metadata handling/publishing in a web metadata catalogue, spatialdata upload in Geoserver, etc etc. With this mode, ``geoflow`` will take each _entity_ for which a set of _actions_ will be executed.|Required
[**metadata**](#geoflow_config_metadata)|Part where the _entity_ set is defined, to be used for executing actions in mode _entity_.|Required with _entity_ mode
[**software**](#geoflow_config_software)|Part where the software to interact with will be defined. It can be a software from where the user wants to get data, or a software where to publish data using [geoflow](https://github.com/eblondel/geoflow) e.g. a GeoNetwork metadata catalogue, a GeoServer, etc.|Optional
[**actions**](#geoflow_config_actions)|Part where the _actions_ to use are defined. These can be source R scripts in case of the _raw_ mode, or entity-based actions in case of mode _entity_. An action put in the list can be enabled/disabled and parameterized with a set of options that is specific to each action.|Required
[**profile**](#geoflow_config_profile)|Global metadata workflow. Information that is common to all entities in case of mode _entity_, and that can be exploited in some of the actions. e.g. add a project logo for all dataset descriptions.|Optional
[**options**](#geoflow_config_options)|Global workflow options|Optional

###### JSON

If we take the different blocks that define the structure of a geoflow configuration (as introduced earlier), the skeleton of the JSON configuration file will look like this:

```{json}
{
  "id": "my-workflow",
  "mode": "entity",
  "metadata": { <metadata sources defined here> },
  "software": [ <pieces of software defined here> ],
  "actions": [ <actions defined here>  ],
  "profile": { <global profile (metadata) defined here> },
  "options": { <global options defined here> },
}
```


<a name="geoflow_config_id"/>

##### 4.3.2 Configuration components – ``id``


This is a just simple string that identifies the user workflow. This string will be referenced in the logs of each workflow execution, and can be useful in case the user handles multiples flows with different configurations (e.g. one workflow per project).

<a name="geoflow_config_mode"/>

##### 4.3.3 Configuration components – ``mode``

At its earliest stage, [geoflow](https://github.com/eblondel/geoflow) was designed to chain a set of processings handled by different scripts. This is known as _raw_ mode, where the user just wants to use geoflow to chain some tasks with a set of R scripts.

In order to facilitate the management of datasets within Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI), including their processing, publication and description with proper metadata, a new mode called _entity_ was introduced. The concept of _entity_ refers to the description of a dataset or subset of it for which the user wants to perform actions. In this mode, each action defined in geoflow will be executed for each entity of the list of entities that will be defined in the [**metadata**](#geoflow_config_metadata) configuration part. 

<a name="geoflow_config_metadata"/>

##### 4.3.4 Configuration components – ``metadata``

###### Description

The metadata part is the section of the workflow configuration where to define the sources of metadata content. Such content is split into two categories:
* _entities_: source for the list of entities, where each _entity_ represents the metadata
* _contacts_: source for the directory of contacts, referenced with roles in the dataset metadata

Whether is for _entities_ or _contacts_, the configuration consists in declaring the ``source`` (a file or URL) and the ``handler``, ie the source format.

The sources of _entities_ and _contacts_ can be handled for different ``handlers`` (for the timebeing ``gsheet`` - for Google spreadsheets, ``csv`` or ``excel`` files). The list of ``entity`` and ``contact`` handlers can be retrieved in R with ``list_entity_handlers()`` and ``list_contact_handlers()``. For the time being, [geoflow](https://github.com/eblondel/geoflow) provides basic format handlers.

> Note: The list of handlers is expected to be extended in the future, eg LDAP handler for contacts.

###### JSON

* JSON snippet for _entities_ handled with a Google spreadsheet:

```{json}
    "entities": {
      "handler": "gsheet",
      "source": "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iG7i3CE0W9zVM3QxWfCjoYbqj1dQvKsMnER6kqwDiqM/edit?usp=sharing"
    }
```

* JSON snippet for _contacts_ handled with a Google spreadsheet:

```{json}
    "contacts" : {
      "handler": "gsheet",
      "source": "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/144NmGsikdIRE578IN0McK9uZEUHZdBuZcGy1pJS6nAg/edit?usp=sharing"
    }
```

* JSON snippet for the metadata part (including _entities_ and _contacts_)

```{json}
  "metadata": {
    "entities": {
      "handler": "gsheet",
      "source": "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iG7i3CE0W9zVM3QxWfCjoYbqj1dQvKsMnER6kqwDiqM/edit?usp=sharing"
    },
    "contacts" : {
      "handler": "gsheet",
      "source": "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/144NmGsikdIRE578IN0McK9uZEUHZdBuZcGy1pJS6nAg/edit?usp=sharing"
    }
  }
```

* JSON snippet for custom handlers

It is possible to use a custom ``handler`` function provided by the user. For this,  the ``handler`` should be the _name_ of the R function to be provided by an R script. The R script must be defined in a extra property named ``script``. In this configuration, the ``source`` property becomes optional (it could be hardcoded in the user's ``handler``` function if this ``source`` is not expected to change from one configuration to another).

The JSON configuration snippet for a custom contact LDAP ``handler`` would look like this:

```{json}
    "contacts" : {
      "handler": "my_ldap_function_to_load_contacts",
      "source": "my_ldap_endpoint",
      "script": "my_ldap_script.R"
    }
```

In R, the ``my_ldap_function_to_load_contacts`` function writen by user in ``my_ldap_script.R`` should implement a function having 2 arguments: ``config`` (to access the overall workflow configuration object loaded with ``initWorkflow``), ``source`` (the source as defined in above JSON snippet):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
  my_ldap_function_to_load_contacts <- function(config, source){
    contacts <- list()
    #here some custom business logic to load contacts from a LDAP
    #....
    return(contacts)
  }

```

<a name="geoflow_config_software"/>

##### 4.3.5 Configuration components – ``software``

###### Description

The ``software`` part of the configuration consists in listing the pieces of software needed for the workflow.

* **List of software managed by geoflow**

By default [geoflow](https://github.com/eblondel/geoflow) manages specific ``software`` to interact with. These software are essentially R _interfaces_ to common tools (databases, web-applications, APIs). The list of ```software`` managed by geoflow can be retrieved in R with ``list_software()``. The list of software managed by ``geoflow`` are:

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(geoflow::list_software(), caption = "List of software supported by geoflow")

```

* **How to configure a software**

To configure a piece of software, the latter should be provided with various elements:
* an **id**: it should be a user string id to identify the software in question.
* a **type**: string, either _input_ (software to use as _source_, to fetch data, eg. a database) or "output" (software to use as _target_, to publish/manage data, eg a metadata catalogue)
* a **software_type**: a string identifying the software types as managed by geoflow (see above table). For example, to declare a GeoServer software, the ``software_type`` with ``id`` "geoserver" will be used.
* a set of **parameters**: that depend on the type of software configured. For the software managed by geoflow, it is possible to interrogate geoflow to know which parameters are needed given a ``software_type`` by doing in R ``list_software_parameters(<software_type>)`` (e.g. for GeoServer type in R ``list_software_parameters("geoserver")``
* a set of **properties**: that depend on the type of software configured. Those are extra configuration elements to use with the software considered. For the software managed by geoflow, it is possible to interrogate geoflow to know which properties can be used fiven a ``software_type`` by doint in R ``list_software_properties(<software_type>)`` (e.g. for Geoserver type in R ``list_software_properties("geoserver")``)

Let's look at "geoserver" ``parameters`` that need to be declared in order to interact with the Geoserver software:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
geoflow::list_software_parameters("geoserver")
```

In similar way, we can list the properties required to configure a data publication in Geoserver:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
geoflow::list_software_properties("geoserver")
```

###### JSON

* JSON snippet for declaring a ```database``` (_input_ software) for data fetching:

```{json}
  {
		"id": "my-database",
		"type": "input",
		"software_type": "dbi",
		"parameters": {
			"drv": "PostgreSQL",
			"user": "user",
			"password": "pwd",
			"host": "localhost",
			"port": "5432",
			"dbname": "mydb"
		}
  }
```

* JSON snippet for declaring a ```geoserver``` (_output_ software) for data publishing:

```{json}
  {
		"id": "my-geoserver",
		"type": "output",
		"software_type": "geoserver",
		"parameters": {
			"url": "http://localhost:800/geoserver",
			"user": "admin",
			"pwd": "geoserver",
			"logger": "DEBUG"
		},
		"properties" : {
			"workspace": "my_geoserver_workspace",
			"datastore": "my_geoserver_datastore"
		}
	}
```

* JSON snippet for the overall "software" component

Since it is a list of software, the base JSON definition will be an _array_ (using square brackets ```[ ]```):

```{json}
"software": [
     <here will be listed the pieces of software>
]
```

* JSON snippet for the overall "software" component (including one _input_ - a database - and one _output_ - a geoserver -)

```{json}
"software": [
  {
		"id": "my-database",
		"type": "input",
		"software_type": "dbi",
		"parameters": {
			"drv": "PostgreSQL",
			"user": "user",
			"password": "pwd",
			"host": "localhost",
			"port": "5432",
			"dbname": "mydb"
		}
  },
  {
		"id": "my-geoserver",
		"type": "output",
		"software_type": "geoserver",
		"parameters": {
			"url": "http://localhost:800/geoserver",
			"user": "admin",
			"pwd": "geoserver",
			"logger": "DEBUG"
		},
		"properties" : {
			"workspace": "my_geoserver_workspace",
			"datastore": "my_geoserver_datastore"
		}
  }
]
```

##### 4.3.6 Configuration components – ``actions``

###### Description

The ``actions`` part of the configuration consists in listing and enabling the tasks (named _actions_ in geoflow) that should be run by the workflow. 

Each _action_ is tightly associated with some _software_ declared in the configuration. In case an _action_ is configured, and the needed _software_ is not configured or misconfigured, geoflow will stop at initialization phase (``initWorkdlow``) and return an error. To check that the configuration of _actions_ and _software_ is ok, the user can trigger ``initWorkflow`` as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
  config <- initWorkflow("config.json")
```

* **List of actions managed by geoflow**

By default [geoflow](https://github.com/eblondel/geoflow) manages specific ``actions`` to run. These _actions_ are essentially R turnkey functions to interact with common tools (databases, web-applications, APIs). The list of ``actions`` managed by geoflow can be retrieved in R with ``list_actions()``. The list of actions managed by ``geoflow`` are:

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(geoflow::list_actions(), caption = "List of actions supported by geoflow")

```

* **How to configure an action**

To configure an ``action``, various elements should be provided:
* an **id**: it should be the identifier of the ``action`` in question
* **run**: set to **true** means the action has to be run. The action can then be deactivated setting it to **false**
* **options**: a set of options that are specific to each ``action``. For a given action, these options can be retrieved in R with the function ``list_action_options("<id of the action>")``. For each option, the name, description and default value are given.

Let's look at "geometa-create-iso-19115" ``action`` options available:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
geoflow::list_action_options("geometa-create-iso-19115")
```

###### JSON

* JSON snippet for an action (eg "geometa-create-iso-19115") with an option enabled:

```{json}
  {
    "id": "geometa-create-iso-19115",
	  "options": {
		  "logo": true
	  },
    "run": true
  }
```

* JSON snippet for the overall list of _actions_

Since it is a list of _actions_, the base JSON definition will be an _array_ (using square brackets ```[ ]```):

```{json}
"actions": [
     <here will be listed the actions to perform>
]
```


<a name="geoflow_config_profile"/>

##### 4.3.7 Configuration components – ``profile``

###### Description
 
The ``profile`` is a part where global workflow metadata can be defined. For the time-being, this is essentially a placeholder. In the future this section may be further enriched with metadata elements that can be shared globally to all _entities_ managed and _actions_ applied on them.

It is already possible to define one or more logo URLs to be shared in actions such as ``geometa_create_iso_19115`` where they are used as metadata graphic overviews.

###### JSON

JSON snippet of _profile_:

```{json}
"profile": {
	"project": "Test geoflow project",
	"organization": "My organization",
	"logos": [
		"https://via.placeholder.com/300x150.png/09f/fff?text=geometa",
		"https://via.placeholder.com/300x150.png/09f/fff?text=ows4R"
	]
}
```

<a name="geoflow_config_options"/>

##### 4.3.8 Configuration components – ``options``


The ``options`` are by definition optional. The table below defines the possible geoflow global options:

Name|Definition|Default value
----|----------|-------------
``line_separator``|Defines the suite of characters used for splitting metadata components with a single tabular cell of an _entity_ (eg. Description field)|**;\n** (likely to be modified for the 1st geoflow release)
