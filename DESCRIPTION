Description: Provides tools to manage 'Spatial Data Infrastructures' (SDI) and to orchestrate, run and automate geospatial (meta)data workflows 
  in compliance with international standards (ISO/TC211, OGC, INSPIRE) with a range of actions such as data upload in spatial databases, 
  publication in 'GeoServer' (<http://geoserver.org>) and metadata publication in 'GeoNetwork' (<https://geonetwork-opensource.org>). It includes actions 
  to manage domain-specific resources, such as ecological metadata (EML) and data, and publish on tools such as 'DataOne' (<https://www.dataone.org/>). It also allows to
  publish data on cloud data infrastructures and tools such as 'Zenodo' or 'Dataverse'. Through a pivot metadata model, 'geoflow' allows to manage 
  a unique source of dataset metadata while offering a way to publish synchronously in various target repositories. The execution of several 
  actions will then allow to cross-reference (meta)data resources in each action performed, offering a way to bind resources between each other 
  (eg. reference 'Zenodo' DOIs in 'GeoNetwork'/'Geoserver' metadata, or vice versa reference 'Geonetwork'/Geoserver' links in 'Zenodo' or EML metadata). The use of
  standardized configuration files allows fully reproducible workflows, in compliance with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) 
  principles.
