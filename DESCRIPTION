Title: Tools to Orchestrate and Run (Meta)Data Management Workflows
Description: Provides an engine to facilitate the orchestration and execution of metadata-driven data management workflows, in compliance with FAIR 
  (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) data principles. By means of a pivot metadata model, extending on the DublinCore (<https://dublincore.org/>) 
  standard, a unique source of metadata can then feed multiple and inter-connected data management actions, in particular actions oriented to the publication on 
  the web of metadata and metadata resources.
  Its primary focus is to provide turn-key actions to manage geospatial (meta)data using ISO/TC211 (<https://committee.iso.org/home/tc211>) 
  and OGC (<https://www.ogc.org/standards>) geographic information standards and best practices (eg. INSPIRE), enforcing and simplifying interaction 
  with known software that compound a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), including spatial databases (eg. PostGIS), metadata catalogues (eg. GeoNetwork, 
  CSW servers), data servers (eg. GeoServer, Thredds). 
  It also includes actions for biodiversity (meta)data standard management including handling of EML metadata, and their management with DataOne servers. 
  Generic (meta)data managers are also included to facilitate the publication to general (meta)data plateforms and portals such as Zenodo (<https://zenodo.org>) 
  or DataVerse (<https://dataverse.org/>).
  The execution of several actions will then allow to cross-reference (meta)data resources in each action performed, offering a way to bind resources between each other 
  (eg. reference 'Zenodo' DOIs in 'GeoNetwork'/'Geoserver' metadata, or vice versa reference 'Geonetwork'/Geoserver' links in 'Zenodo' or EML metadata). The use of
  standardized configuration files allows fully reproducible workflows to facilitate the work of data and information managers.
